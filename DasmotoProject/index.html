<!-- P.S. I'm not sure how my documents will look on your end, but I have yet
to figure out how to get my text from going past the cutoff line, instead of a
neverending line of code (i.e. paragraphs). So what I do is use my 'Enter' key to
keep it all aligned.

I have some lines kept in and commented out for practice and to have the
knowledge ingrained for future use, as well as to see how it works. I have to
say, this was a fun project! -->
